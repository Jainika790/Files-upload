# MY PORTFOLIO & WORK DONE ON BOOTCAMP.
Hi I made this project during the 7 days free bootcamp that was been conducted by <b> SHAPE AI </b>.
My instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (a Data Analyst at Jio).
I got to learn a lot during these days and it was very helpful for me.
<br>I got to have hands on experience on - <li>HTML, CSS & BOOTSTRAP</li>
<br>Every single topics were explained from basics.
Now i have been making a website of my Portfolio and that is been uploaded here.
My portfolio includes my works and all my skills along with the contact reference of my mail id and github link in it.
